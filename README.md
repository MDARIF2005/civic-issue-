Civic Issue Classification with Geolocation
Abstract

Urban areas often face common issues like road damage, garbage accumulation, and drainage blockages that affect cleanliness, safety, and sustainability. Detecting these problems manually is time-consuming and inefficient.
This project focuses on developing an AI-based system that can automatically classify civic issues from images using image classification techniques and obtain the exact location using geolocation.

When a user captures or uploads an image, the trained machine learning model processes it to identify the type of issue—such as road damage, garbage, or drainage blockage. Simultaneously, JavaScript’s Geolocation API retrieves the latitude and longitude of where the image was taken.

Currently, the system’s scope is limited to detecting and localizing civic issues. It provides the foundation for future enhancements like reporting, visualization on maps, or integration with smart city monitoring systems to support sustainable urban development.
